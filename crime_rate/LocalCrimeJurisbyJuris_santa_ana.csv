,,,"1. The figures shown in this column for the offense of rape were estimated using the legacy UCR definition of rape - previously known as ""Forcible"" rape.  See UCR Offense Definitions for further information.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,2. The figures shown in this column for the offense of rape were estimated using the revised Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) definition of rape. In December 2011 the UCR program changed its definition of SRS rape to this revised definition. This change can be seen in the UCR data starting in 2013. Prior to 2013 this column will be blank. See UCR Offense Definitions for further information.,,,,,,,,,,,
